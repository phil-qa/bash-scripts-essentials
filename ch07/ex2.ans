a)	Which command will show records for all contractors?
Answer: 
$ grep –c '^$' employees
Were you tempted to use the wc tool here? It would, of course, work but is unnecessary and an overhead.
b)	Show all countries that are not in R&D?
Answer: 
$ grep -v 'R&D' employees
c)	How many employees are either software or hardware engineers?
Answer: 
$ grep -ciE 'software|hardware' employees
d)	Display the employee first name and surname.
Answer:
$ cut –d\; -f1-2 employees
e)	Display the employee first name, surname and the length of service. Translate each semicolon to a tab character when stdout is generated.
Answer: 
$ cut –d\; -f1-2,7 employees | tr ';' '\t'
Alternatively, awk can to this job as well.
$ awk -F\; 'OFS="\t" {print $1,$2,$7}' employees
f)	List the first three letters of each surname.
Answer: 
$ cut –d\; -f2 employees | cut -c1-3 
g)	List the first three letters of each surname, but only for employees working in R&D.
Answer: 
$ grep ‘R&D’ employees | cut –d\; -f2 | cut -c1-3
h)	List first name and surname of five employees that have been employed the longest (at the output, first name and surname should be separated with a tab).
Answer: 
$ sort -t\; -k7nr employees | head -5 | cut -d\; -f1,2 | tr ';' '\t'

Or, using awk instead of cut and tr:
$ sort -t\; -k7nr employees | head -5 | awk -F\; 'OFS="\t" {print $1,$2}'
i)	Show all the different office locations in the employees table.
Answer: 
$ cut –d\; -f4 employees | sort | uniq
