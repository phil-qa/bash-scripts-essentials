# Purpose:      To allow background operation of the bc calculator
# Description:  Two named pipes called bcin and bcout, in /tmp will be used.

# Save the requested expression. Notice the use of "$*" â€“ need
# to preserve all arguments as a single string.
expr="$*"

# Create the two named pipes

mkfifo /tmp/bcin 2>/dev/null
mkfifo /tmp/bcout 2>/dev/null

# start bc in the background, connected to bcin for reading and bcout for writing
bc </tmp/bcin >/tmp/bcout &

# Associate file descriptor 3 for writing into /tmp/bcin
exec 3>/tmp/bcin 
# Associate file descriptor 4 for reading from /tmp/bcout
exec 4</tmp/bcout


# Send the requested expression to bc
echo "scale=4;$expr" >&3

read result <&4
